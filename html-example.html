            <p>Kirsten and I arrived in Topolò late in the evening after Vida and Aljaž picked us up from Venice airport(!). The morning after, we met Vida early for breakfast at Cafe Dora with Dora. She had made a cake with berries and we ate bread with crumbly cheese and drank coffee. After breakfast, Kirsten and I went for a walk up the hill, "towards the sun" as Kirsten said. We stopped a few times to admire the view and catch our breathe. The photo above was taken by Kirsten and uploaded to our <a href="https://www.are.na/benjamin-earl/site-specific-an-introduction-to-making-placeful-websites">are.na channel</a>. Now we are sitting in Vida's house, preparing for the workshop on Friday.</p>
            <p>Something to do with sites that I found in the glossary of the Robida website:</p>
            <blockquote>
                "As defined in the Oxford Dictionary, "hyperlocal" is an adjective that relates to or focuses on matters concerning a small community or a specific geographical area."
